The potential of digital-twin technology, involving the creation of precise digital replicas of physical objects, to reshape AR experiences in 3D object tracking and localization scenarios is significant. However, enabling robust 3D object tracking in dynamic mobile AR environments remains a formidable challenge. These scenarios often require a more robust pose estimator capable of handling the inherent sensor-level measurement noise. In this paper, recognizing the challenges of comprehensive solutions in existing literature, we propose a transformer-based 6DoF pose estimator designed to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy under real-world noisy data. To systematically validate the new solution's performance against the prior art, we also introduce a novel RGBD dataset called Digital Twin Tracking Dataset (DTTD) v2, which is focused on digital-twin object tracking scenarios. Expanded from an existing DTTD v1, the new dataset adds digital-twin data captured using a cutting-edge mobile RGBD sensor suite on Apple iPhone 14 Pro, expanding the applicability of our approach to iPhone sensor data. Through extensive experimentation and in-depth analysis, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methods under significant depth data errors, surpassing the performance of existing baselines.
