* Exchange Student in Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, 2022-2023

Research experience
======
* Research Assistant - Microsoft Research Asia
  * Supervisor: Dr. Jianlong Fu, Senior Research Manager, Multimedia Search and Mining Group at Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China Beijing, China\\
  • Published a real-world multi-modal imitation learning policy model to address a generalization of pick-and-place robot manipulation tasks.\\
  • Accomplished independently a 30Hz robotic manipulation paradigm involving VR teleportation, control of dexterous hands, and Franka robot arm.\\
  • Contributed to the design of the model by utilizing Vision Foundation Models and multi-modal fusion of semantic, geometric, and temporal observations, achieving sample-efficient generalization learning with an overall accuracy of 81.25%.\\
* Research Assistant - Berkeley OpenARK Lab December 2022 – Present
  * Supervisor: Prof. Allen Yang, Executive Director of FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality, UC Berkeley, US Berkeley, United States
  • Published an RGBD-based 6DoF pose estimation paradigm for Digital Twin applications, withstanding the low-quality depth data in mobile devices.
  • Led and established the only RGBD 6DoF pose estimation database (DTTDv2) captured by iPhone 14 Pro, including 18 rigid objects and 100 scenes.
  • Conducted LiDAR depth analysis on 47668 frames of the DTTD database and introduced a novel depth-ADD metric for quantitative measurement.
  • Contributed to a Transformer-based 6DoF pose estimator designed to withstand noisy depth, surpassing performances of all existing baselines.
  • Developed an efficient data collection paradigm (uploaded on GitHub), utilizing OptiTrack system and a self-developed software in iPhone 14 Pro.
* Research Assistant - Robot Laboratory of South China University of Technology May 2022 – September 2022
  *Supervisor: Prof. Zhijun Zhang, South China University of Technology, China Guangzhou, China
  • Explored face recognition algorithms and independently implemented SOTA algorithms (yolov5, dlib, arcface) on robot Ubuntu Linux system.
  • Developed an innovative software enabling robots to engage in conversations with users, memorize unfamiliar faces, and recognize previously encountered faces in real-world robots, which was successfully deployed into a commercial robot.
* Research Assistant - Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Steroid Drug Research and Development June 2021 – January 2022
  * Supervisor: Prof. Baoting Zhu, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China Shenzhen, China
  • Explored machine learning approaches in protein-ligand docking, and ran dynamics simulations using Discovery Studio and Gaussian.
  • Analyzed the diverse Cyclooxygenases-flavonoids simulation data by statistics and machine learning to predict the protein-ligand binding affinity.
  • Summarized output statistic data of 10 ligands and explained their biological meaning with activators or inhibitors.
