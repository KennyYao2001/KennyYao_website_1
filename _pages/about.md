Hi there <img src='https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/24524555/238178097-766d336d-b87d-44ba-807c-c51de2bc6b4d.gif' alt='GIF示例' style='width: auto; height: 1em;'>, I am currently a **Data Science major** undergraduate from the School of Data Science at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**. In 2022, I was a visiting student at the Department of EECS, **University of California, Berkeley**. 

My professional and research interest lies in Computer Vision and Robotics Learning, aiming to enhance robots' 3D perception. I have the honor of being advised by [Prof. Allen Yang](https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/people/allen-y-yang/) from the OpenARK Lab at the Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley. I was also honored to be advised by [Dr. Jianlong Fu](https://jianlong-fu.github.io/) from the Multimedia Search and Mining Group, at Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China. My research areas include 6D pose estimation, Robotics Pertaining, and Reinforcement Learning. I would like to explore more interesting areas in 3D and robotics in the future!

**Research Interest**: 3D Computer Vision, 6D pose estimation, Robotics Pertaining, Reinforcement Learning, and VR/AR/MR
